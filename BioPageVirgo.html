                        <p class="bioTxt">Virgo Fuss is a Finnish melodic alternative indie rock band with a taste of progressive approach. 
                            The bands journey began in 2011 when a group of friends decided that their long years of playing metal music 
                            had to come to an end and it was time for a change.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bioTxt">The band released their first EP 'Look to your left' in 2015 and not long after had their first live show in Lahti. 
                            Since then, the band has released two singles, 
                            one standalone single 'Floating' in 2016 and another single 'Flamingos' which predated their first album.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bioTxt">The band released their first full-length album 'Contours' in September 2018. 
                            'Contours' consists of the band's strongest work throughout the years and 
                            Since the release of the album the band got to enjoy a brief period of touring around southern Finland, 
                            until the pandemic hit, and live shows were cancelled.
                        </p>
                        <p class="bioTxt">Currently Virgo Fuss is working on their second album after 
                            the quiet years during the pandemic and live shows will soon follow.
